abstract = "A chemical scale χ is presented which characterizes each atom in the periodic table. It allows a single two-dimensional structure map (χA, χB) to be plotted for all binary compounds with a given stoichiometry ABn. The resultant map for 574 AB compounds shows excellent structural separation, the 75 octet sp-sp compounds being perfectly separated amongst themselves."
